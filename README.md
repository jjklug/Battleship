## Battleship Project
Project created for my Intermediate Programming class using java that simulates the board game battleship.
It is a text-version of the game that allows you to choose your locations of the ships in a txt file by giving start and end positions to each ship.
In this version of battleship, you play against a computer that will randomly make moves against you. It is a pretty basic version of the game, but it is still a fully operating 
battleship simulation that you can use to play against the computer.
